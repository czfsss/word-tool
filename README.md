## Word Document Processing Toolkit

A comprehensive Word document processing plugin collection designed specifically for the Dify platform, providing PDF document conversion, intelligent chunking, and annotation features. Supports Chinese document processing with localized processing strategies to ensure data security.

## üöÄ Core Features

### 1. PDF to Word Converter (pdf_to_word)

- **Function Description**: Convert PDF documents to editable Word documents
- **Technical Implementation**: Based on `pdf2docx` library, supports complex layouts and format preservation
- **Supported Formats**: PDF ‚Üí DOCX
- **Custom Features**: Support for custom output file names

### 2. Word Intelligent Chunker (word_chunk) ‚≠ê

- **Function Description**: Intelligently analyze the structure of Word documents and perform reasonable document chunking based on potential headings, trying to ensure that sentence segmentation during document chunking does not cause incomplete semantic recognition by models. Note: The Word format should be as standardized as possible, and it works better for contract and legal documents.
- **Application Scenarios**: Document analysis, content extraction, knowledge management
- **Chunking Strategy**: Intelligent chunking algorithm based on paragraph semantics and document structure
- **Quantity Control**: Support for custom chunk numbers (maximum 30), with the 30-chunk limit set because iteration nodes can have at most 30 iteration objects.

### 3. Word Document Annotator (word_comment)

- **Function Description**: Add genuine native comments to Word documents
- **Technical Features**: Uses `python-docx 1.2.0` native comment API
- **Comment Features**: Precise text positioning, format preservation, support for custom commenters
- **Input Method**: JSON format comment data with flexible configuration

## üìä Word Intelligent Chunking Algorithm Details

### Algorithm Overview

The Word intelligent chunker employs multi-level document analysis strategies, combining semantic understanding and structural recognition to achieve intelligent document segmentation. This algorithm is specifically optimized for contract, legal, and policy documents, intelligently identifying document structures and performing reasonable chunking to ensure that document segmentation does not cause incomplete semantic recognition by models.

### Core Algorithm Flow

1. **Document Element Extraction and Preprocessing**: Extract paragraph and table content in the original document order, preserving document structure information.
2. **Document Type Recognition**: Identify document types (general, contract, policy) and adopt specific processing strategies for different types.
3. **Intelligent Title Recognition**: Recognize titles through multiple dimensions including style names, regex pattern matching, format feature analysis, and document type-specific patterns.
4. **Semantic Chunking Processing**: Adopt different chunking strategies based on different element types such as titles, tables, long paragraphs, short paragraphs, and special paragraphs.
5. **Chunk Quantity Control**: When the number of chunks exceeds the limit, use a mathematical grouping algorithm for intelligent merging.

### Algorithm Features

1. **Document Type Optimization**: Optimized for specific document types like contracts and policies, recognizing document-specific structures.
2. **Multi-dimensional Title Detection**: Combines style names, regex patterns, format features, and document type-specific patterns for title recognition.
3. **Intelligent Semantic Chunking**: Adopts different chunking strategies based on document element types to maintain semantic integrity.
4. **Special Table Processing**: Ensures tables are in the same chunk as related titles, maintaining contextual relevance.
5. **Precise Quantity Control**: Uses mathematical grouping algorithms to ensure precise chunk quantity control, avoiding over-chunking or under-chunking.
6. **Hierarchical Structure Recognition**: Capable of recognizing document hierarchical structures and maintaining logical integrity.
